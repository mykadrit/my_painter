# Simple Painter 🖌️:
#### with using tkinter
`pip install tkinter`


This code creates a simple paint program using Tkinter, allowing you to draw on a canvas with different brush sizes and colors. The paint program includes options to change the brush size and color. Note that this is a basic example, and you can expand upon it by adding more features such as shapes, an eraser, or saving/loading drawings.
